## Habitat Modeling

The Stream Salmonid Simulator (S3) model incorporates two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models for specific Klamath River sections to calculate habitat suitability based on environmental variables, such as river flow and channel width. These models use [Weighted Usable Habitat Area (WUA)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1107/ofr20191107_a1.pdf) curves created for specific life stages and habitat types of salmon. The WUA information derived from 2D models (covering 11.3 km or 3.6% of the Klamath's river length) is extrapolated to unmodeled reaches, enabling habitat assessments across larger river sections.

Three S3 models have been developed. The original model was developed to support Fall Run Chinook and later updated to include the Trinity River and Coho populations.

### Reaches

#### Klamath River

Modeled sections on the Klamath include `r paste0(habitat_data |> filter(river == "Klamath River") |> pull(location_name), collapse = ", ")` . The exact location of each reach was estimated using Google Earth. It is also unknown how long each reach extends.

An SRH-1D model was also developed for the Lower Klamath River, below the former location of Iron Gate Dam.

```{r echo=FALSE}
habitat_data |> 
  filter(river == "Klamath River") |> 
  mutate(river_mile = paste0(rm_start, "-", rm_end)) |> 
  select(river, location_name, model_type, river_mile, status) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

#### Trinity River

The entire 40-mile Restoration Reach of the Trinity River was modeled using SRH-2D. It is currently unclear what the exact extents are.

```{r echo=FALSE}
habitat_data |> 
  filter(river == "Trinity River") |> 
  select(river, location_name, model_type, length_miles, status) |> 
  knitr::kable()

```

#### In Development

-   Resource Environmental Services (RES) is currently developing HEC-EFM models for Jenny Creek, Camp Creek, Beaver Creek, and Spencer Creek. It is unclear the exact extents of these models.

-   Julie Alexander at Oregon State University has developed a 2D hydraulic model for use in analid research; it is unclear the exact extents of this model.
